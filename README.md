# DYNAFormer
DynAMFormer: Enhancing Transformer Segmentation with Dynamic Anchor Mask for Medical Imaging

##  Introduction

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of DYNAFormer, Enhancing Transformer Segmentation with Dynamic Anchor Mask for Medical Imaging.
DYNAFormer use an anchor mask-guided mechanism that enhances segmentation by using each positional query as an anchor mask, instead of traditional anchor boxes in methods like DINO and MaskDINO, enabling adaptive focus on relevant areas with pixel-level precision rather than coarse bounding box regions. This approach allows more precise, adaptive feature learning through dynamic refinement across decoder layers.

##  Polyp instance segmentation dataset (PolypDB_INS)
In this work, Introduce PolypDB_INS, a dataset of 4,403 images with 4,918 polyps, gathered from multiple sources and annotated for Sessile and Pedunculated polyp instances, which supports the development of polyp instance segmentation tasks. Besides, PolypDB_INS is also adapted for polyp semantic segmentation by converting instance segmentation masks into binary masks. These masks identify regions containing polyps without distinguishing between specific types, enhancing the datasetâ€™s applicability to broader segmentation tasks. The dataset is avaiable at [download link](<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1olTs9hZA4o81vfrYO32oZVuGzvTVNIQ_/view?usp=sharing>)
